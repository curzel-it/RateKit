# RateKit

RateKit is a simple utility to prompt the users of your iOS or macOS apps to submit a review after a certain number of runs.

This utility by default will not immediatly call for an app review, instead it keeps track until a minimum threshold of calls is hit before prompting the user for a review. It will also only request one review for each app version that is released.
